## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   PHP version 8.1 or higher with the following extensions:
    *   `intl`
    *   `mbstring`
    *   `json` (enabled by default)
    *   `mysqlnd` (if using MySQL)
    *   `libcurl` (if using `HTTP\CURLRequest`)
    *   `gd` or `imagick` (often required for QR code generation or image manipulation)
*   Composer (PHP package manager)
*   Git (Version control)
*   A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or use PHP's built-in server via `php spark serve`
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Setup Environment Configuration:**
    *   Copy the `env` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp env .env
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file and configure it for your environment. Key settings include:
        *   `CI_ENVIRONMENT = development`
        *   `app.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8080'` (or your local development URL)
        *   Database settings (e.g., `database.default.hostname`, `database.default.database`, `database.default.username`, `database.default.password`)
        *   `app.universityEmailDomain = 'youruniversity.edu'` (Add this if you have a specific setting for university email validation)

4.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    This will create the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    php spark migrate
    ```

5.  **(Optional) Run Database Seeders:**
    If you have seeders to populate initial data (e.g., default roles, admin user):
    ```bash
    php spark db:seed YourSeederName
    ```
    *(Replace `YourSeederName` with the actual name of your seeder class.)*

6.  **Set Folder Permissions:**
    Ensure the `writable` directory is writable by the web server.
    ```bash
    chmod -R 777 writable/
    ```
    *(For production, use more restrictive permissions and ensure the web server user owns the `writable` directory.)*

7.  **Web Server Configuration (Important Change with `index.php`):**
    The `index.php` file is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the `public` folder for better security. Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx) to point its document root to your project's `public` folder.

    *   **Apache:** You might use a `.htaccess` file in your project root (if `AllowOverride` is enabled) or configure a VirtualHost.
    *   **Nginx:** Configure the `root` directive in your server block.

    For development, you can use CodeIgniter's built-in server:

8.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    php spark serve
    ```
    This will typically start the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üîß Configuration Details

Beyond the `.env` file, specific configurations might be found in:

*   `app/Config/`: Contains application-specific configuration files (Routes, Filters, Events, etc.).
*   **University Email Validation:** The system validates user emails against a specific university domain. Ensure `app.universityEmailDomain` in your `.env` file is set correctly (e.g., `app.universityEmailDomain = "university.ac.uk"`). If no such setting exists in code, describe how this is configured.
*   **Role Permissions:** Role definitions and their associated permissions are managed [describe where - e.g., "within the database" or "via an admin interface once logged in"].

---

## üí° Usage

1.  **Access the application:** Open your configured `baseURL` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) in a web browser.
2.  **Login:** Use your university email address and password. New users may need to register (if self-registration is enabled) or be created by an administrator.
3.  **Navigate:** Use the sidebar/navigation menu to access different modules:
    *   Dashboard
    *   Inventory List (with advanced search)
    *   Add New Item
    *   Manage Categories/Locations (if applicable)
    *   User Management (for admins)
4.  **Adding Items:** Items can be added individually through a form or in bulk by uploading a CSV file.
5.  **QR Codes:** QR codes are automatically generated for new items. These can be printed and attached to physical assets. Scanning a QR code (e.g., with a mobile QR scanner app) will open a URL leading directly to that item's detail page in the system.
